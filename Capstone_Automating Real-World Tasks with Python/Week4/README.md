You work for an online fruit store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. When each supplier has new products for your store, they give you an image and a description of each product.

Given a bunch of images and descriptions of each of the new products, you’ll:

  *  Upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints.
  *  Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.
  *  Since this process is key to your business's success, you need to make sure that it keeps running! 

So, you’ll also:
  *  Run a script on your web server to monitor system health.
  *  Send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.
