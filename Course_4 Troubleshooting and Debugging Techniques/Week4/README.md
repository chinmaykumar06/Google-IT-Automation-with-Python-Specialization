## Introduction
You're a member of your company's IT department. A colleague that recently left the company wrote a program that's 90% complete; it's designed to read some data files with information on employees and then generate a report. It's up to you to finish the code -- this includes fixing any errors, bugs, and slowness that might be in the unfinished code.

## Prerequisites:
You should have a sound knowledge of the following things prior to performing the lab:

  * Debugging (gathering information, root cause analysis, and remediation)
  * Identifying and understanding system performance (I/O, Network, CPU, Memory)
  * Understanding and troubleshooting the environment around the program (file system, OS, etc.)
