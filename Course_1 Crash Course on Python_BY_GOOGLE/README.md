## About this Course

This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. 
No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; 
be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this 
knowledge to solve a complex programming problem.

For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a **[script](https://github.com/chinmaykumar06/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python-Specialization/blob/master/Course_1%20Crash%20Course%20on%20Python_BY_GOOGLE/WEEK6/coursera.txt)**. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.
