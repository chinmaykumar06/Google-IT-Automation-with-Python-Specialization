Twelve years! Twelve years of striving! and at last
  My power is--secure? Still Pompey lives
  And has an army and Metellus strives
  To wipe out his defeats. The net is cast:
  Cast, and draws ever tighter: and my men
  Grumble and mutter, near to mutiny.
  Perpenna stirs up treason: like a fen
  Of black and quaking marshes, my own camp
  Boils up all foulness, gapes to swallow me.
  The black death-chariot waits, the coursers stamp--
  Yet I have made a law, have curbed the tribes,
  Built up a senate, founded schools, withstood
  For twelve long years the iron arm of Rome.
  I have not spared my time, my gold, my blood.
  And now all vanishes in plots and gibes--
  I love this warm, brown land; it is my home.
  And yet--to see the Forum once again!
  Ah, Nydia! Nydia! Had you not died
  I could have crossed the Alps, have crushed these men,
  These unclean vultures, tearing at Romeâ€™s side;
  I could have brought back the Republic--then.
  You died. I still fight on, but I am old.
  Pompey is young, and though I beat him now,
  He will be victor, as the end will show.
  Ah, Plancus, enter! Is the night so cold
  That you need shroud yourself in that great cloak?
  You too, Perpenna, Cimon, you who broke
  So bravely through the foe, you fear a draught?
  Be seated, friends!
